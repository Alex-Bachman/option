    <h1>A Sampler of Classic Metal</h1>
    <p class="shadow">Starting in the late 1960s, bands had begun looking for a
        heavier sound, more aggressive vocals and instrumentation,
        harsh distortion on the guitars, fast paced drumming and either harsh ( screamed or growled)
        or clean (sung normally) vocals, although the harsher vocals would came later in the genres
        development.</p>
    <p class="Sabbath">Black Sabbath is often credited as one of the very first metal bands, their sound would go on to
        influence
        generations of musicians even to this day, alongside Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, these three
        bands
        would ignite the spark that makes metal what it is today. When many people think of metal,
        they often think of screaming and noise, while that may be true for some people, I think that
        this genre carries a lot of value in its history and influences, as well as being enjoyable to
        listen to. In terms of genres that influenced bands, we look to the 60s, with psych rock, jazz,
        and blues rock being significant contributors to the traditional heavy metal sound.</p>
    <p class="Misc"> Jazz and
        metal songs often share similar song structures. Although the genres have evolved over the
        years, there is still strong similarities, mainly in the musical arrangements in terms of
        an ensemble. Melodic instruments such as guitar and piano are backed up by a rhythm section
        consisting of bass and drums, often times with a vocalist though often times without!</p>
    <p class="vines">Take a jazz song and add heavy distortion and harshen up the vocals and youâ€™ve got metal on
        your
        hands.
        This site will take a look at a variety of subgenres of metal including, the new wave of British
        heavy metal,
        traditional American thrash metal, traditional Norwegian black metal, heavy metal, and power
        metal.</p>
